Project Four

I was able to keep Lex and Parse fully working, I fixed what I could in Semantic Analysis and I got single scope code generation working.
I also got multi-scope code generation working and single if statements. While statements do not work, I was not able to figure out how to add
multiple instances in my jump table.
